### Objective
The main goal of this lab was to learn the basic functionality of the Arduino Uno and the Arduino IDE. The focus of the first several parts of the lab are to write programs using the Arduino IDE to control LEDs and servos. The last part of this lab focused on putting together the beginning of our robot and getting it to move. 

### Procedure
We split up into two groups of two for this lab. Both groups progressed through the lab as follows:<br/>
#### Materials
* 1 Arduino Uno
* 1 USB A/B Cable
* 1 Continuous rotation servos
* 1 Pushbutton
* 1 LED
* 1 Potentiometer
* Several Resistors in the kiloohms range
* 1 Solderless breadboard<br/>
#### Part 1: Communicating Between the UNO and IDE
For this part of the lab, we used the “Blink” example code to learn how to program the Arduino. The code used was:<br/>
